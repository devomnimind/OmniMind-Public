## 💼 RECOMMENDATION

### ✅ ACTION: PROCEED WITH PHASED IMPLEMENTATION

**Why This Approach:**

✓ **Non-Disruptive:** Only adds ~350 new tests, doesn't modify existing 4,732  
✓ **Low Risk:** Gap closure is clearly scoped to 7 well-defined areas  
✓ **Fast Execution:** 5-6 days with 1-2 developers  
✓ **Production Ready:** System is already approved after 500-cycle audit  
✓ **Scalable:** Can be implemented in phases, deployed incrementally
