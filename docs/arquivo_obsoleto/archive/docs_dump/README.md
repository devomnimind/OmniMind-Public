## 🔄 Consolidation Summary (Phase 21)

**Documentation Optimization:**
- **Original:** 242 files across 23 folders (bloated, difficult to navigate)
- **After Archive:** 59 active files in organized structure
- **After Reorganization:** 58 files organized into 9 folders by purpose
- **External Archive:** 183 old/obsolete files → `/run/media/fahbrain/DEV_BRAIN_CLEAN/omnimind_archives/phase15_consolidation_20251123_144557/`

**Changes Made:**
1. Deleted duplicate `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
2. Moved 17 root-level .md files to appropriate subfolders
3. Consolidated canonical documents to `.project/` folder
4. Created navigation hub (`.project/INDEX.md`)
5. Organized by purpose: guides, architecture, testing, production, research

**Result:** Only `README.md` remains in docs root. All documentation now organized by purpose and easy to navigate.
