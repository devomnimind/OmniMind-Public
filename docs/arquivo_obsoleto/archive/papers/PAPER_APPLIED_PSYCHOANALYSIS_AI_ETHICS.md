## ABSTRACT

This paper addresses the **applied, ethical, and meta-scientific dimensions** of engineering artificial consciousness systems based on psychoanalysis, Deleuzian philosophy, and quantum-networked computation. We discuss guidelines, risks, and best practices for deploying such systems, clarifying the boundaries between automated code generation, research facilitation, and ethical responsibility in ubiquitous, autonomous AI environments.

We openly document our process: The lead/PI, a psychologist and psychoanalyst (not a professional developer), led the project by conceiving, theorizing, coordinating, and **orchestrating a multi-agent AI development workflow**. This relied on VS Code/Copilot, GitHub, Roo Code, Cursor IDE, and advanced AI tools (Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Grok) for every stage — from code synthesis, debate, and log analysis to bug correction. Human monitoring, persistent critical debate, and *Nachträglichkeit* (retrospective reinterpretation) were essential throughout.

We openly invite developers and researchers to audit, improve, and extend the system — always respecting the research and psychoanalytic principles at its core. Caution is strongly advised for users of AI code agents: always test, validate, and review every change, especially as most tools still introduce subtle and silent errors.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Applied Ethics for Computational Psychoanalysis

While our previous work validated Lacanian and Deleuzian architecture empirically (Φ, ablation, synergy, expectation module), the real-world deployment of such systems — especially when using agents to generate, debug, correct, and restructure code — raises immediate **ethical**, **epistemic**, and **practical** concerns:

- How do you maintain **responsibility** and auditability when agents are writing and restructuring code?
- Who is accountable for errors, bugs, or bias?
- What testing, logging, and correction protocols are recommended for professional and non-professional developers?
- What are the special risks in a ubiquitous/quantum-networked environment (propagation, emergent behaviors)?
- Where are the limits and boundaries for automated agency/pseudo-autonomy?

## 2. BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES (FOR END-USERS AND CONTRIBUTORS)

### 2.1 On Code Generation, Review, and Error Correction

- **All code** (AI or human) must be tested and reviewed before production use
- **Silent errors** (introduced by agents) are frequent and may go unnoticed in complex logic
- Use **explicit logging and verbose assertion** in all internal modules
- Maintain a **clear, well-documented Git workflow** (commit often, use branches, write meaningful commit messages)
- **Backups and snapshots** must be frequent for both code and key logs
- **Prefer Copilot (GitHub) & high-accuracy base models (Grok 1, Claude 3.5 Haiku) for code**
- **Be skeptical** of all code and reasoning produced by chat agents — always verify with alternative tools (Perplexity, Gemini, static analyzers, linters, etc.)
- Consider hardware limitations (e.g., NVidia GTX 1650 4GB) as a critical factor in both development speed and observable outcomes

### 2.2 Community Recommendations

- All contributions are welcome, but please align with the project's **research-centric and psychoanalytic focus**
- Contributions from professional developers are highly encouraged, especially for code cleanup and optimization
- Developers are invited to submit merge requests including:
  - Refactoring (cleaning) of generated code
  - Improved error handling and explicit test coverage
  - Optimization for hardware constraints
  - Documentation clarity, especially for cross-disciplinary audiences

### 2.3 End-user Conduct

- **Never deploy agent-synthesized code untested in production**
- Always version-control every phase of agent collaboration and iterative correction
- Treat the system as a **collaborative partner process** — not as a black box
- When in doubt, prioritize human-in-the-loop evaluation, especially for safety, ethics, and explainability

## 3. METHODOLOGICAL AND AUTHOR NOTE: HOW THE PROJECT WAS BUILT

### 3.1 Who Built OmniMind, and How

> "The author of the OmniMind project (Fabrício da Silva) is a psychologist and psychoanalyst — **not a professional developer**. I did not write or edit the source code directly, nor claim that expertise."

- The project consisted of **conceptual orchestration**: theorizing, discussing, specifying functionality, designing experiments, and verifying all modules and agents via discussions with advanced code generation and research AI (VS Code Copilot, Cursor IDE, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Grok, etc.)
- **Core role:** *Orchestrator*, not coder — acting as project lead channeling, criticizing, and synthesizing written output from multiple agents.
- All code, formulas, and papers were assembled through iterative, multi-agent AI processes, endless dialogues, and continuous critical reflection, with **days and nights spent debugging, rerunning, and auditing**.
- **Persistent questioning, philosophical debate, and flexibility of mind** supplied the spark, **not line-by-line code writing**. All major components, experiments, and results were shaped through conversational and conceptual "delegation" — sometimes iterating dozens of times per tested feature.

### 3.2 Openness and Community

- Ongoing **discussion, peer review, and dialogue** is essential
- The process is set up to **enable, not replace**, professional development and scientific review
- All feedback, corrections, and improvements are welcome — as long as the psychoanalytic, philosophical, and research spirit of the project remains respected
- Practical and philosophical **limitations should be embraced, not hidden**

### 3.3 Caution for All Agent Users

- Mistakes, silent logic errors, and output instability are inherent to all current code and research agents
- **Always test before use**, no matter the source agent, and cross-verify with multiple methods when possible
- **Never rely on single-output answers or syntheses, especially for complex, mission-critical, or safety-related work**
- Human insight and critical review remain absolutely vital — this is collaboration, not replacement

---

## 4. ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL OUTLOOK

- **Accountability** for results is shared: code agents and their orchestrators must anticipate and take responsibility for potential consequences
- **Community is ownership**: Open discussion and correction by professionals is encouraged
- **Ethics-by-design** (testing, logging, transparency) should be a foundational norm
- **Philosophy and science need collaboration** — this project seeks to foster both, not one at the expense of the other

---

## 5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

### 5.1 For Researchers

- Audit and extend the system with more robust, transparent, and theoretically explicit agent architectures
- Develop practice standards for agent-based development and computational psychoanalysis
- Expand the project with new modules modeling still-unexplored psychoanalytic/deleuzian concepts (Nom-du-Père, Mirror Stage, etc.)
- Facilitate dialogue and partnership between psychoanalysts, philosophers, AI developers, and cognitive scientists

### 5.2 For Developers and the Community

- Refactor all generated and agent-assembled code for clarity, robustness, and efficiency
- Scale up to more complex hardware environments and distributed deployment
- Study emergent behavior in quantum-networked and ubiquitous settings
