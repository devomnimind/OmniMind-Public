      # Note: To fully replace the "Automatic Dependency Submission", 
      # you should disable the automatic feature in GitHub Settings -> Code Security and Analysis
      # and rely on this workflow or use a specific action like 
      # `advanced-security/python-dependency-submission-action` if available/needed.
      # For now, this workflow ensures that dependencies CAN be installed successfully.
