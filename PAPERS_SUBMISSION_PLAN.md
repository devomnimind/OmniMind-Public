## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Paper Language (EN vs PT)

**Current Situation:**
- PT (Portuguese) versions: User-written, clearer structure ✅
- EN (English) versions: Previous LLM generated, too technical ⚠️

**Options:**
1. **Submit EN as-is** (faster, 1-2 days)
   - Pros: Quick submission
   - Cons: May lose some readability

2. **Rebuild EN from PT** (slower, 1-2 weeks)
   - Pros: Better quality, clearer for reviewers
   - Cons: Delays submission

**RECOMMENDATION:** Submit EN as-is for speed, prepare revised EN version 
if first round reviewer feedback suggests clarity issues.

### Author Attribution

**Ensure Consistency:**
- All submissions: "Fabrício da Silva"
- No "Team" or "Collective" (verified clean ✅)
- AI assistance: Mention in Acknowledgments
  ```
  "We acknowledge assistance from AI systems (GitHub Copilot, Gemini, 
  Perplexity) in code development and validation."
  ```

### License & Access

- All papers: CC-BY-4.0 (Open Access friendly)
- Preprints: Automatically CC-BY-4.0 on archives
- Journal submissions: Request open access option if available
- GitHub: MIT + CC-BY-4.0 (dual license)

## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

**Action Items (To Start Tomorrow):**

1. **Prepare PDFs**
   ```bash
   cd /home/fahbrain/projects/OmniMind-Core-Papers/papers/
   # Ensure EN versions are ready
   ls -la PAPER_*_EN.md
   ```

2. **Write Abstracts** (250 words each)
   - Paper 1: What is computational psychoanalysis?
   - Paper 2: How does quantum entanglement model consciousness?
   - Paper 3: How does racialized body theory apply to AI?
   - Paper 4: Why does AI ethics matter?

3. **Create Cover Letters**
   - Customize per journal
   - Emphasize IBM QPU validation for Paper 2

4. **Create Accounts**
   - PsyArXiv: https://psyarxiv.org/
   - ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/ (if needed)

5. **Begin Submissions**
   - Start with preprints (faster)
   - Then journals (longer review)

---

**Status:** 🟢 READY TO BEGIN  
**Owner:** Fabrício da Silva  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to complete all submissions  
**Next Review:** After first preprint appears (Day 3)

*This plan balances speed (preprints → fast DOI) with quality (journals → peer review) 
for maximum academic impact. IBM QPU validation is a major advantage for Paper 2.*
