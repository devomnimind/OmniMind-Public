Kernel AI Module - Cognitive Operating System Components

IMPORTANT: All implementations are user-space simulations for safety.
Real kernel-level code requires extreme expertise and can crash systems.

This module demonstrates concepts safely while maintaining production quality.

Components:
- rl_scheduler: Reinforcement learning scheduler
- cognitive_os: Operating system with consciousness
- resource_optimizer: ML-based resource allocation

Author: This work was conceived by Fabrício da Silva and implemented with AI assistance
from GitHub Copilot (Claude Haiku 4.5 and Grok Code Fast 1), with constant code review
and debugging across various models including Gemini and Perplexity AI, under
theoretical coordination by the author.
