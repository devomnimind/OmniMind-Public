Kernel AI Module - Cognitive Operating System Components

IMPORTANT: All implementations are user-space simulations for safety.
Real kernel-level code requires extreme expertise and can crash systems.

This module demonstrates concepts safely while maintaining production quality.

Components:
- rl_scheduler: Reinforcement learning scheduler
- cognitive_os: Operating system with consciousness
- resource_optimizer: ML-based resource allocation
