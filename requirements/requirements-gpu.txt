# GPU-specific dependencies for OmniMind
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED (16 DEC 2025) - GPU configuration moved to requirements_core_quantum.txt
#
# ✅ CURRENT: Use requirements_core_quantum.txt instead
#    This file kept only for historical reference
#
# All GPU support is now in:
# - requirements_core_quantum.txt (qiskit-aer-gpu, cuQuantum cu12, PyTorch cu121)
#
# ⚠️ DO NOT install packages from here - they will conflict with quantum setup!

# DEPRECATED: PyTorch GPU (MOVED to requirements_core_quantum.txt)
# ❌ torch==2.5.1 (was installed wrongly with cu122)
# ✅ CURRENT: torch==2.5.1+cu121 (via requirements_core_quantum.txt)

# NVIDIA Monitoring
nvidia-ml-py>=12.560.30

# DEPRECATED: GPU-accelerated libraries (MOVED to requirements_core_quantum.txt)
# ❌ These are now in requirements_core_quantum.txt:
# cuquantum-cu12==25.11.0
# custatevec-cu12==1.11.0
# cutensor-cu12==2.4.1
